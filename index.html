            Hi, I’m Vivek Murugulla, the creator of Reel Talk. This site is my personal space for reviews, analysis, and commentary on movies, games, and comics. I care deeply about storytelling, whether it comes from a big studio release, a cult favorite, or something that makes you stop and think, “What did I just watch?”

            Reel Talk started as a fun creative outlet and slowly turned into something more intentional. Over time, it became a place to dig a little deeper into why stories work, why they don’t, and why some stick with us long after the credits roll. I try to approach everything here with honesty, curiosity, and just enough humor to keep things grounded.
        </p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">

            The Story So Far

        <p class="about-paragraph">
            What started as a small creative experiment has grown into a long-term passion project:
        </p>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li>2023: Began writing about films purely for fun and to organize my thoughts</li>
            <li>2024: Refined my voice and structure, expanding into games and comics</li>
            <li>2025: Built this website from scratch to give all my writing a permanent home</li>
            <li>2026: Continues to evolve as an ongoing, independent project</li>
        </ul>

            My Background
        </h1>
        <p class="about-paragraph">
            I graduated from the University of Georgia in December 2025 with a degree in Management Information Systems. While that may not sound directly related to movies, it shapes how I approach this site, balancing structure with creativity. Everything on Reel Talk, from the design to the writing, is created and maintained by me and is meant to keep improving over time.  
        </p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">
            When I’m not watching something new or working on the site, I’m focused on sharpening my skills in web development, design, and digital content creation.
