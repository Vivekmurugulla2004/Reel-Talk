            Hi, I’m Vivek Murugulla, a film enthusiast, podcast creator, and the mind behind this website. 
            Reel Talk started as a fun side project: a podcast where I shared my honest, unfiltered thoughts on movies. 
            Over time, it became something more turning into a way to connect with people who love cinema as much as I do. 
            Whether it was summer blockbusters, underappreciated gems, or films that make you go “…what did I just watch?”, I loved talking about them all.
        </p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">
            Now, this site is the next step in that journey. Here, I combine:
            <ul class="about-paragraph">
                <li>Podcast episodes from the original project (so they finally have a permanent home)</li>
                <li>Movie reviews, both classic and brand-new</li>
                <li>Casual commentary and personal essays about film, storytelling, and pop culture</li>
                <li>A personal portfolio, showcasing my skills in web development, design, and content creation</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            The Story So Far
           </h1> 
        </p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">
            What started as a small creative experiment has grown into a long-term passion project:
            <ul class="about-paragraph">
                <li>2023 – Launched the Reel Talk podcast, sharing honest, in-depth discussions about films I love (and some I don’t)</li>
                <li>2023/Early 2024 – Expanded the episode library, refined my review structure, and began writing more thoughtful commentary</li>
                <li>Late 2024 – Started planning a permanent, independent home for Reel Talk to bring together all content in one place</li>
                <li>2025 – Built this website from scratch, uniting the podcast archive, movie reviews, and film commentary into a single central hub</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            My Background
        </h1>
        <p class="about-paragraph">
            I’m currently studying Management Information Systems at the University of Georgia, where I’m developing the technical and strategic skills to merge my passion for storytelling with technology. 
            Everything you see here, from the layout to the writing, is built by me, and it’s meant to keep evolving.
        </p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">
            When I’m not watching movies or building the site, I’m focused on honing my skills in web development, design, and content creation.
