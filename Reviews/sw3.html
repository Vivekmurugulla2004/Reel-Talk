        <p class="review-paragraph">
            Revenge of the Sith is the best of the prequels, and I still don’t love the prequels. George Lucas is at the helm. Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, and Ian McDiarmid lead the cast. The movie hustles to set the table for the original trilogy. It looks great and sounds huge, but it often feels hollow. The plot clicks together. The people inside it rarely do.
        </p>
        <p class="review-paragraph">
            Anakin’s fall is the sticking point. It happens quickly, then quicker, and I never feel the slide. The film points to fear of loss, a bruised ego, and Palpatine’s grooming, but it treats those motives like bullet points. Scenes that should feel like a slow moral collapse play like someone flipped a switch. Christensen swings for it, and McDiarmid is a blast, but the turn doesn’t breathe. I don’t see a person slipping away beat by beat. It reads like an assignment, not a tragedy.
        </p>
        <p class="review-paragraph">
            The writing feels busy and thin at the same time. Lots of lore. Stiff dialogue. Jedi Council debates that sound important but rarely push character. For long stretches, talk is just a pit stop between effects. Padmé gets stuck staring out windows. Obi-Wan fares better, but even his best moments serve logistics more than relationships.
        <p class="review-paragraph">
           The action is constant and, after a while, numbing. The opener, the Utapau chase, Order 66, the Mustafar duel, all staged to perfection. The scale is big. The impact is small. Bodies fly. Sabers clash. The camera rarely hangs on what it costs. When the film slows down, like Obi-Wan pleading on the lava bank, it finally finds the raw feeling it wants. Then it rushes off to the next setup.
        </p>
        <p class="review-paragraph">
            And setup is the mission. Babies must be hidden. Names must be spoken. The suit must seal. Planets need future meaning. You can see the seams. Instead of inevitability, you feel obligation. This happens because it has to, not because the story earned it.
        </p>
        <p class="review-paragraph">
            I wanted more Vader, sure, but that’s not the real problem. The brief mask reveal is fine. The issue is treating Vader like a finished label rather than a person we understand from the inside. Without a richer fall, the rise feels empty. The “Noooo” doesn’t help.
        <p class="review-paragraph">
            Two things land hard. John Williams brings a killer score. “Battle of the Heroes” and “Anakin’s Betrayal” carry more feeling than most dialogue scenes. The music stitches together moments that might float apart. And McDiarmid’s Palpatine is magnetic. The whispers, the smiles, the slow pull toward the dark give the film its only steady sense of danger.
        </p>
        <p class="review-paragraph">
            Modern context muddies it. The Obi-Wan Kenobi series adds space and check-ins that make some beats here feel off. Not ruinous, just odd. The show finds breathing room the movie doesn’t, which highlights how cramped this script is.
        </p>
        <p class="review-paragraph">
           In the end, Revenge of the Sith is a smooth conveyor belt. It delivers what it needs to with craft and speed, not with soul. Best of the prequels, yes. That still leaves a lot missing. I give it a 2.5/5.

            (We learn from mistakes. The sequels proved that. Right?)
